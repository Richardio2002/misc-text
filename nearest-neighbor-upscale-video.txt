Nearest Neighbor Upscale Low-Res Video File
===========================================
The two pieces of software I used were Shotcut (GUI) and ffmpeg (command line).
* https://shotcut.org/
* https://ffmpeg.org/
I gave a summary in the description of the playlist. I will reproduce that here.
~~~ Technical Details ~~~
Processing steps:
1. In Shotcut: mov video upscaled to 1440x1080, 4:3, original framerate using nearest neighbor interpolation. Exported as H.264 mp4 file.
2. Using ffmpeg: original audio (from mov file) remuxed with new video (from mp4 file) to a mkv file for YouTube uploading.
~~~ End ~~~
For you, I wrote these more detailed instructions.
~~~ Instructions ~~~
For each video clip, I did this:
1. Run command:
         ffprobe original-file.mov
   to determine original framerate and aspect ratio.
   Look for "fps" in the output.
   Example excerpt from output:
         Stream #0:1(eng): Video: svq3 (SVQ3 / 0x33515653), yuvj420p(pc), 80x60, 50 kb/s, 15 fps, 15 tbr, 600 tbn, 600 tbc (default)
   So we know that this clip should be 15 FPS. Make a note of that.
   From 80x60 image size, we know that the aspect ratio is 4:3.
   Some basic math:
         60 / 3 = 20
         20 * 4 = 80
         20 * 3 = 60
   To get this information, you could also use VLC:
          Tools > Codec Information
[ For steps 2-5, I made a tutorial video.

2. Open Shotcut. Make a new custom video mode with the settings we just found.
   * Set the image size (resolution) to
     the number of lines that you want to upscale to (1080)
     in the aspect ratio of the original video (4:3) using square pixels.
     Some basic math:
           1080 / 3 = 360
           360 * 4 = 1440
           360 * 3 = 1080
     So we know the size should be 1440x1080 pixels.
   * Set the framerate to that of the original video file.
      From our note earlier, we know that it should be 15 FPS.
3. Make a new Shotcut project using the custom video mode.
4. Drag the original video file onto the timeline.
5. Export the video with the settings shown in the tutorial video.
6. Run command:
         ffmpeg -i shotcut-export.mp4 -i original-file.mov -map 0:v:0 -map 1:a:0 -c copy final-muxed-output.mkv
   to combine the upscaled video (shotcut-export.mp4)
   with the original file's audio
   to produce the MKV file (final-muxed-output.mkv)
   that you will upload to YouTube.
